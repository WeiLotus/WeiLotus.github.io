#  Xiaohan (Lotus) Wei — Personal Website

Welcome to the personal website of Xiaohan (Lotus) Wei — a data analyst with a deep appreciation for clarity, structure, and the meaningful stories behind data.

This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a customized theme to reflect both my analytical mindset and personal design sensibilities. It serves as a digital space to showcase my professional journey, project highlights, and philosophies around data, storytelling, and human-centered design.

##  About Me

> *"I'm someone who finds meaning in structure, clarity in complexity, and connection in the details. With a background in statistics and a deep sense of care for the people behind the data, I bring a grounded, human-centered approach to every project. This space reflects how I think, work, and move through the world — with purpose, sensitivity, and intention."*
